## Tidy data

After manually tidying the data sheet, it looks like this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("~/polybox/Shared/Data Science Lecture Planning - shared folder/4 Datasets/groenigen14sci_tidy_example.csv")
df
```

There are still two aspects that violate the tidy data paradigm.

First, the column `Experiment` contains information for multiple aspects: the experiment name (in the example above: 'China OTC'), and the nitrogen fertilisation treatment ('low N'). This should be separated into two columns:
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  separate(Experiment, sep = " - ", into = c("experiment", "nfert"))
df
```

The second non-tidy aspect is that the same variable (soil organic matter content) appears in two columns, one representing the mean of multiple measurements under ambient CO2 (`aco2_mean`, number of individual measurements given by `n_a`), and one representing the mean of measurements under elevated CO2 (`eco2_mean`, number given by `n_e`). This is a practical format here because we can easily calculate quantities that are a function of both. For example, calculating the log-response ratio as:
```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(logrr = log(eco2_mean / aco2_mean))
```

However, for plotting with `ggplot`, where the information whether it's from ambient or from elevated CO2 is mapped onto the 'color' aesthetic, we need to convert this from "wide format" into a "long format".
```{r}
df_long <- df %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(aco2_mean, eco2_mean), names_to = "co2_treatment", values_to = "mean")
df_long
```

This can now be plotted, whereby `co2_treatment` is mapped onto the `color` aesthetic, and with an automatically generated legend.
```{r}
df_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean, y = ..density.., color = co2_treatment)) +
  geom_density()
```
